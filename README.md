# gate_garage_controller
A node.js webserver with sockets.io and onoff package to control gpio pins on raspberry pi. 

## Work in progress
The current state of the project is to control a gate opener with a relay and a simple node.js program. 


I will be adding an additional button for garage door control and possibly DNS or SiriShortcuts compatibility. Might have to make a REST api. Not sure
