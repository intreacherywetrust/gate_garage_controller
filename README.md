# gate_garage_controller
A node.js webserver with sockets.io and onoff package to control gpio pins on raspberry pi. 

## Work in progress
The current state of the project is to control a gate opener with a relay and a simple node.js program. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
The next step is to add a garage door button and state control. 

=======
## Planned:
- Implement garage door button
- Implement reed switch and display status of both the gate and the garage door to the UI
- Create RESTful endpoints so that non LAN control can be acheived.
